# ðŸ–§ A Network Topology designed for Three Companies
This document outlines a network topology designed for three separate companies, implemented in Cisco Packet Tracer. The primary focus lies on efficient subnetting and enabling seamless inter-company communication through the RIPv2 routing protocol.

## Designed Network

## Key Features
- **Multi-company network:** Connects three distinct companies - CMP X, CMP Y, and CMP Z.
- **Dedicated PC rooms:** Each company has dedicated PC rooms with the following configurations:
  - *CMP X:* 5 rooms, each with 1 PC
  - *CMP Y:* 3 rooms, each with 3 PCs
  - *CMP Z:* 2 rooms, each with 4 PCs
- **Granular subnetting:** Each company room operates on a dedicated subnet, maximizing network efficiency and security.
- **Cost-effective hardware:**
  - *Routers:* Generic routers equipped with RIPv2 for intra- and inter-company routing.
  - *Switches:* Generic switches, utilizing only 3 of 4 ports for optimal resource allocation.
- **Static IP addressing:** Each PC has a statically assigned IP address for clear identification and control.
- **Cisco Packet Tracer compatibility:** Fully functional in Cisco Packet Tracer (version 6.2 or later).
